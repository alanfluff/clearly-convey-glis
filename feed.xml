                <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I build and test the accessibility of websites.</p>
<p>Except clearly I have yet to prove that here. Apologies internet person, I will be adding some actual content in due course.</p>

<h2>Me</h2>
<p>I became somewhat obsessed with semantic HTML, and with CSS, starting in 2001 and that obsession only got worse when I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designing_with_Web_Standards"><cite>Designing with Web Standards</cite></a> by Jeffrey Zeldman in 2003. Hungry for more I moved on to <cite>Web Standards Solutions</cite> by Dan Cederholm in 2004, and <cite>CSS: The Definitive Guide</cite> by Eric Meyer.</p>
<p>I've now channeled these early web obsessions to focus on building websites, and auditing websites for accessibility.Â </p>
